You may want to explore its functions through [Shapely User Manual](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) on adding the functionality to work with planar geometric features, including the creation and manipulation of geometries such as points, polylines, and polygons; get familiar with topology on proximity (including adjacency, connectivity and containment) relationships, as well as spatial analysis functions, e.g.intersection, union, dissolve, etc.\n",

GEOS implements the OpenGIS Simple Features for SQL spatial predicate functions and spatial operators. `Shapely` is not concerned with data formats or coordinate systems, but can be readily integrated with other packages. It provides spatial analysis methods that return new geometric objects. To complete the first section on spatial operation, we will use the following datasets: London stations as Point data, London railways as Polyline data and London LSOAs as Polygon data.\n",

Buffer could be taken one step further, on generating guard areas that can be added for a specified distance (or a range) around points, lines or polygons.
